Diffusion models generate incredible audio but they're slow. A typical 4-second clip takes 30 seconds to render. That's fine for production, useless for performance.

We've been experimenting with consistency distillation to bring the step count from 50 down to 4. The quality drops, but in a live context the artifacts become part of the texture — grainy, unstable, alive.

The current prototype runs on a single GPU and generates 512ms chunks with ~80ms latency. Not zero, but workable if you lean into the delay as a musical element rather than fighting it.

The interesting part: feeding the model its own output as a conditioning signal creates feedback loops that evolve over time. Leave it running and it drifts into unexpected territories.
